I really have been missing out a lot on learning; I only have been seeing the pressures and tasks, missing out on the knowledge, pride and growth that it is supposed to result in.
I planned to turn a new leaf (lol), to change, to be more concerned about my growth, to follow the process, to learn as I go, never to relent, or rest unnecessarily, to put away every distractions and flimsy excuses, to prioritize this over every other engagements; to be more focused notwithstanding any obstacle; Lord help me!
